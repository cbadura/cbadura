ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone. My name is Christian

## ABOUT ME 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a student in software engineering at 42 Berlin (since Nov. '22). Before that, I studied on Qwasar/Upskill for about a year.

ðŸ‘€ For the last twelve months I've been interested in C/C++, UNIX and systems programming. I've completed a lot of projects at 42 Berlin, among others my own Bash-like shell, a Raycaster graphics engine (both in C), and a web server in C++.

:surfer: I have also dipped my toes into Python and Ruby. Java was my first language and I still have fond memories of the book _Objects First with Java_ and the BlueJ IDE

:climbing: Currently looking for a job in the field for when I finish the 42 curriculum!
